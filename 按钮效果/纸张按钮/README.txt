A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/ashleynolan/pen/djpCG.

 I made this demo to try out and illustrate some of the subtle button effects you can create just using box-shadow and borders on pseudoâ€“elements.

Inspired by the work I saw a while back over on Beemuse (http://beemuse.com/paper) and so this is a heavily tweaked more dynamic version of those effects.

Also see Nicolas Gallaghers previous post on effects like this:

Tested in latest Chrome and Firefox, but no reason it shouldn't work in all latest browsers.
